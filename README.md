# Pyrol
## About Me
Pyrol: PyTorch framework for Robotics control, Optimization, and Learning algorithms. This is meant for designing modular components to quickly test and implement concepts. This library is still in early stages of development.

### Why Pyrol?
Many of the libraries and interfaces, especially those
for robotics can be messy to read and understand. Additionally,
some of the robotics simulators used in the machine
learning community are not technically open source. For
people who are looking for modular, easy to read algorithms
we hope PyRoL will be able to deliver on that.

### Who are we?
As of right now we are just two graduate students in the
robotics field. Any help is appreciated! Our github handles
are: gabriel80808 and ColinTogashi.

### References & Citations
Remember to cite original publications before citing this framework. There should be short writeups in the code about each algorithm. Other than that if you feel like we've deserved a citation please feel
free to do so.
