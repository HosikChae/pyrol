# PyRoL
## About Me
This project implements a framework based on PyTorch
for Robotic systems, Learning algorithms, and
classical control algorithms.

This project builds on many existing algorithms
in Pytorch and Gazebo particularly for robotics.
This project hopes to simplify many of the tedious
steps in understanding implementation of control
and reinforcement learning.
