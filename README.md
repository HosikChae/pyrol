# PyROL
## About Me
This project implements a framework based on PyTorch
for Robotics control, Optimization, and Learning algorithms (PyROL).
Many of the algorithms here will be referenced to
rightful authors. Many state-of-the-art machine learning
and classical control algorithms are developed in an
easy-to-understand manner mainly for robotic systems
and control (other applications are welcomed).

##### Why PyRoL?
Many of the libraries and interfaces, especially those
for robotics can be messy to read and understand. Additionally,
some of the robotics simulators used in the machine
learning community are not technically open source. For
people who are looking for modular, easy to read algorithms
we hope PyRoL will be able to deliver on that.

##### Who are we?
As of right now we are just two graduate students in the
robotics field. Any help is appreciated! Our github handles
are: gabriel80808 and ColinTogashi.

##### References & Citations
Please cite those papers first before citing this framework.
Of course we hope to implement our own algorithms as
well, which you can cite. Other than our own algorithms only
if you feel like we've deserved a citation please feel
free to do so.
